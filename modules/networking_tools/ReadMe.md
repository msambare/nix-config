### inetutils

The GNU network utilities suite provides the following tools: ftp(d), hostname, ifconfig, inetd, logger, ping, rcp, rexec(d), rlogin(d), rsh(d), syslogd, talk(d), telnet(d), tftp(d), traceroute, uucpd, and whois.

### iputils

A set of small useful utilities for Linux networking including:

- arping: send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host
- clockdiff: measure clock difference between hosts
- ping: send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
- tracepath: traces path to a network host discovering MTU along this path

### mtr

mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs in a single network diagnostic tool.

As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints running statistics about each machine.

### netcat-gnu

Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
